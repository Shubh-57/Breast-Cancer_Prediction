# Breast-Cancer_Prediction_Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer using a dataset of clinical and demographic features. The model is trained on a large dataset of labeled breast cancer cases, enabling accurate prediction of malignancy in breast tissue.


• The dataset used for training and testing the model is Breast Cancer Wisconsin(Diagnostic) dataset from Kaggle.

• The machine learning model employed in this project is Logistic Regression model.

• Accuracy:

On train data -> 94.7253 %

On test data -> 92.9824 %
