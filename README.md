# Breast-Cancer_Prediction_Project

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting breast cancer using a dataset of clinical and demographic features. Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques and algorithms, the model will be trained on a large dataset of labeled breast cancer cases, enabling accurate prediction of malignancy in breast tissue.
